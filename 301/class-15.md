**Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago**
* Gender Gap in Tech Industry
  - There is a large gender gap in the technology field. For example in 2014, 70% of employees in the tech industry were male. In technical roles, women make up even a smaller part of the workforce. 
  - It wasn't always this way because back in the 70s and 80s women made up 37% of the computer science graduates, but those numbers have continously dopped since then. 
  - Programming is a very lucrative skill to have in the modern world. About half of the best paying jobs is in the tech field, and it is continously is growing. Not as many women are taking AP-level computer science exam.

* Marketing games
  - Gaming and computers since the 80s have been marketed towards men, which is part of the reason why their isn't as many women in the industry and gave rise to male computer culture. Games were geared toward male interests.

* Experience gap widens
  - Experience gap - term coined by Jane Margolis in the 90s, which was caused by the fact that women weren't as familiar with programming languages, and men had more experience with programming when they would enter university due to having more exposure to it from an early age. Many women opted out of computer-related courses. 
  - This male dominated enviroment became an obstacle for women entering into it due to the thinking that women weren't inclined towards math or engineering. Also, women are less likely to stay in the tech industry than their male counter parts due to isolation and being excluded from their male counter parts.
