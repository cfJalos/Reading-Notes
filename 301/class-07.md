# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

## From nytimes.com

* That the team norm greatly affects not just the team, team member but also how they work together.

* Traits of a perfect team

  * Equality in distribution of "conversational turn-taking"

  * High "average social sensitivity"

  * Skill at intuiting how other felt based on their tone of voice, expressions and other non-verbal cues
Clear goals of team

  * Culture of dependability

  * Psychological safety, more than anything else, is critical to team work

  * Communication and empathy

    * building blocks of forging real connections

  * In best teams, members listen to one another & show sensitivity to feelings and needs

## Conversation

### Roy Fielding

*  wrote the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet and did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

## The web ## 

* HTTP - That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

  * it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

## web pages

* The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

* A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser.

* URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. 

## new formats

* “Web Services” or "APIs".

  * computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.

## polymorphism 

 * What are the nouns? Laptop, bottle, book, paper. Now, what are some things you can do to all of these things

 * instead of me being able to say to you, "get the bottle," and "get the magazine," and "get the book"; what if instead we needed to come up with different verbs for each of the nouns? I couldn't use the word "get" universally, but instead had to think up a new word for each verb/noun combination. "shmet the bottle", "mandle the magazine", "zorp the book"
